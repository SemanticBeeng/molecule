# ‚òç Molecule

Molecule is a type safe and intuitive Scala query/modelling DSL for 
[Datomic][datomic] - the immutable database of facts. 

As an example: to find

_Names of twitter/facebook_page communities in neighborhoods of southern districts_
 
we can compose a "molecule query" that is very close to our
human sentence:

```scala
Community.name.`type`("twitter" or "facebook_page")
  .Neighborhood.District.region("sw" or "s" or "se")
```

Molecule transforms this at compile time (with macros) to a little more elaborate Datalog query string and
 input rules that finds those communities in the Datomic database:

<pre>
[:find ?a
 :in $ %
 :where
   [?ent :community/name ?a]
   (rule1 ?ent)
   [?ent :community/neighborhood ?c]
   [?c :neighborhood/district ?d]
   (rule2 ?d)]

INPUTS:
List(
  datomic.db.Db@xxx,
  [[[rule1 ?ent] [?ent :community/type ":community.type/twitter"]]
   [[rule1 ?ent] [?ent :community/type ":community.type/facebook_page"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/sw"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/s"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/se"]]]
)
</pre>

#### Benefits

By not having to write such complex Datalog queries and rules "by hand", Molecule 
allows you to

- Type less
- Make type safe queries with inferred return types
- Use your domain terms directly as query building blocks
- Model complex queries intuitively (easier to understand and maintain)
- Reduce syntactic noise
- Focus more on your domain and less on queries

#### Possible drawbacks

We still need to explore how far Molecule can match the expressive powers
 of Datalog. So far, all 
 examples in the
[Seattle tutorial][seattle] have been 
"molecularized" succesfully (see the 
[Molecule Seattle tutorial][tutorial] and 
[code][tutorialcode]). So as a proof-of-concept it looks promising...

## Getting started

- [Quick introduction][intro] to Datomic/Molecule
- [Setup Database][setup]: initiate a Datomic database and create a database schema with Molecule
- [Populate Database][populate]: populate a Datomic database with Molecule
- [Molecule Seattle tutorial][tutorial] examples of using Molecule (based on the 
[Datomic Seattle tutorial][seattle])
- Tests in [SeattleQueries][tutorialqueries] shows the queries produced by the molecules in the tutorial
- Tests in [SeattleTransformations][tutorialtransformations] shows the full dsl -> model -> query -> query string 
transformations of molecules

## Using Molecule

### Download code

1. `git clone https://github.com/marcgrue/molecule.git`
2. `sbt compile`
3. Import into your IDE
4. Run tests and poke around...


### Dependency in your project

Molecule 0.2.1 for Scala 2.11.4 is available at
[Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/scalamolecule/molecule_2.11/)
 so that you can add a dependency in your sbt file to `"org.scalamolecule" % "molecule_2.11" % "0.2.1"`.

Since Molecule generates boilerplate code from your definitions it also needs to have the `DslBoilerplate.scala` file in your project folder. Please have a look at how the sbt build file
 of the Molecule project itself puts things together and simply copy that to your own project:

2. Setup your sbt build file [as in Molecule][moleculesbt]: 
    - Add library dependency `"org.scalamolecule" % "molecule_2.11" % "0.2.1"`
    - List directories where you have your [definition file(s)][setup]
3. Define your domain schema in a [schema definition file][setup]
4. `sbt compile`
5. Import into your IDE
6. [Setup your database][setup]
7. [Populate your database][populate] with data
8. [Make molecule queries][tutorial]
